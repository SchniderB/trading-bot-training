algorithm3 :
    => Time-step between each price check seems to perform best when it is set at 1 min and
    will be set to 1 min by default from now on to free one parameter in the benchmark
    - Net benefit rate cut-off for trade decisions
    - Median price over a certain window of time as a cut-off for all BUY trade decisions
    - Median price over a certain window of time as a cut-off for all SELL trade decisions as
    an additional condition to the min benefit set

algorithm3.1 :
    - All parameters are the same as for algorithm3, but the time window for a trade to
    be accepted is +/- 15 seconds instead of +/- 30 seconds. This time window will remain
    the same for the following algorithms unless specified

algorithm3.2 :
    - All parameters are the same as for algorithm3.1, but the window of the BUY and SELL
    history size has been enlarged so as to test longest time histories
    - Time-step was set to 2 minutes instead of 1 to decrease the computation time

    January 2019

    => Benefit rate cut-off is set with a default value of 1.05, based on the results of the
    algorithm 3 and 3.1
    => History of the median price for BUY trade decisions is set to a size of 10 (x2 min),
    based on the results of the algorithm 3 and 3.1
    => History of the median price for SELL trade decisions is set to a size of 21600 (x2 min),
    based on the results of the algorithms 3
    - History size of the linear regression
    - Slope of the linear regression

algorithm4.3 :
    - Based on algorithm 4 with a hard start date threshold set on the 1st of
    July 2019

algorithm5 (opportunist algorithm trial) :
    => Based on the small size of the dataset, the time-step is set to 1 minute
    => Only trades on the data of December 2020
    => Owing to its opportunistic purpose, the algorithm is only tested on the following
    cryptocurrencies: "XXBT", "XETH", "ADA", "XXLM"
    - A drop rate of the median close price is computed over a short interval of time
    - The short interval over which the drop rate is computed
    - A recovery rate (increase rate after a drop) is used as a trigger for the BUY
    - A minimal benefit after the BUY requires to be met to SELL
    - A linear regression is computed over a specific interval of time
    The algorithm will catch a quick median price drop (few hours) and will override
    a minimal value until it reaches the real minimum. If the prices increases more
    than the recovery rate times the minimum, the price is considered as recovering
    and the algorithm will BUY. Similarly, once a BUY is performed and the minimal
    benefit is exceeded, the price will override the maximum, until a drop of the magnitude
    of the recovery rate is observed, which will trigger the SELL action.
